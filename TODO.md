# Urgent

# Priority

- CTF function for calculating point spread function from the same set of parameters.

# Enhancements

- Rework the `histogram_2d_...` functions to match the numpy `histogram2d` api. This includes passing bins as an argument rather than assuming points have already been transformed.
