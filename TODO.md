### Urgent

### Priority

 - [ ] Complete docstrings for all classes/methods
 - [ ] Decide on consistent naming conventions and methods for parsing/storing 2DTM information
 - [ ] Implement unit tests across the repository
    - [ ] Core calculation methods
    - [ ] Import/export methods
    - [ ] Composition of objects

### Enhancements

 - [ ] Rework the `histogram_nd_...` functions to match the numpy `histogram2d` api. This includes passing bins as an argument rather than assuming points have already been transformed
 - [ ] CTF function for calculating point spread function from the same set of parameters.
 - [ ] Higher order implementations of CTF functions
